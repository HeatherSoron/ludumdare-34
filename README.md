A game jam entry for Ludum Dare 34.

# Description

You are the Gaia Vine, an alien being capable of spreading life to new lands.

You've drifted down to a new, barren island, and wish to spread shrubbery and trees across the land. Make your way from one shore, to the other!

# Gameplay

Right-click (or any key) to throw seeds, which grow trees and rarely bushes.

Left-click to swing on trees. Note: click just _past_ the target.

The distance you throw seeds depends on whether you're swinging, stationary, or moving through the air.

Only two seeds can be thrown at a time - time your tosses strategically!

When you reach the far end of the island, a few stats will be shown. Have fun swinging around and planting seeds until then!

## Stats

NUMBER OF TREES: How many trees you've planted
MAX SPEED: Maximum player velocity, in pixels per second (lag-adjusted)
MAX HEIGHT: How high you've reached relative to the bottom of the ocean, in pixels
FURTHEST FLIGHT: The maximum distance you've traveled without colliding with the ground, in pixels
