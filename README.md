A game jam entry for Ludum Dare 34.

# Description

You are the Gaia Vine, an alien being capable of spreading life to new lands.

You've drifted down to a new, barren island, and wish to spread shrubbery and trees across the land. Make your way from one shore, to the other!

# Gameplay

Right-click (or any key) to throw seeds, which grow trees.

Left-click to swing on trees.

The distance you throw seeds depends on whether you're swinging, stationary, or moving through the air.

Only two seeds can be thrown at a time - time your tosses strategically!
